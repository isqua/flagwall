# flagwall

[![Flagwall: create your personalized wallpaper](./public/flagwall.910d720c.png)](https://isqua.github.io/flagwall/)

I made this app for myself and friends. I wanted to put flags of visited countries on my phone's lock screen. That's why I made this simple application where you can select countries and background color, and download a picture with flags to your phone.

How to start application locally:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```
